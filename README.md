# Dimensionality Reduction

Implemented Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to project high dimensionality data to 2D data, plotted data and visually 
compared against SVD and t-SNE in Python. 

We implemented PCA algorithm to perform dimensionality reduction on the given biomedical data 
files. We perform dimensionality reduction to better represent and analyze data. The basic concept is to combine dimensions 
that are highly correlated or dependent and focus on the independent ones. We end up with a smaller set of dimensions that 
retains the variance in original data.

Implemented PCA from scratch on 3 data files (pca_a.txt, pca_b.txt, pca_c.txt)to get the two-dimensional data points. 
For each dataset, data points with a scatter plot created and colored according to their disease names.

Applied existing packages to run SVD and t-SNE algorithms and got two-dimensional data points. Visualized
the data points of the two algorithms on the three datasets and compared it with the PCA results.
